# Releasing

A new version of the Keptn Jenkins library is released as needed when
there are fixes and features ready.

## Versioning

The versioning of the Keptn Jenkins library follows [semver](https://semver.org/).
This means, every version number consists of three parts (x.y.z) that have a
different meaning and describe the type of change this version introduces.

- **Patch:** (x.y.**z**): A patch version only includes fixes and small patches.
- **Minor:** (x.**y**.z): A minor version includes new features that do **NOT**
  introduce a breaking change.
- **Major:** (**x**.y.z): A major version is the only version that can contain
  breaking changes.

## How to release

### Typical case: create a new version
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-jenkins-library/releases)
of [keptn-sandbox/keptn-jenkins-library](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-jenkins-library/) repository
and create a new release using the appropriate tag in semver format (creating it if it doesn't exist yet)
on the appropriate branch (`master` most of the time).
Make sure to provide a description and auto-generate release notes using the github UI.

### Special cases: bugfixing and hotfixes for older versions

Bugs must be fixed on master first and then backported to the appropriate versions.

If the target major and minor versions onto which backport the fix are the same as the
latest version released from master the usual procedure described in the previous paragraph is sufficient
and a new release can be created simply increasing the patch number of the latest release.

If the fixes must be ported to older library versions, a `release branch` starting from the last commit on
master that has been tagged with the same major and minor version should be used (creating it if necessary)
using the format `release/x.y.z`.

Once the backport of the fix is present on the release branch a new release for the same major/minor version
can be created on such branch by increasing the patch version as usual.

For *critical* fixes a hotfix of a specific patch version can be created using a `hotfix branch` that
starts at the **exact major, minor and patch version** using the format `hotfix/x.y.z` and tagging the version
as `x.y.z-hotfix.**n**.**timestamp**` where n is the progressive number of the hotfixes applied (hopefully only
1 is needed) and timestamp is in format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. Contrary to the bugfix process, hotfix releases
should be used only in exceptional cases where it's impossible for the user to move to a newer patch version.
The need for hotfixes will be evaluate on a case-by-case basis depending on the impact of the issue.
